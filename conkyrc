# if own_window is yes, you may specify type normal, desktop,
# dock, panel or override (default: normal).  Desktop windows are
# special windows that have no window decorations; are always
# visible on your desktop; do not appear in your pager or taskbar;
# and are sticky across all workspaces. Panel windows reserve
# space along a desktop edge, just like panels and taskbars,
# preventing maximized windows from overlapping them. The edge is
# chosen based on the alignment option. Override windows are not
# under the control of the window manager. Hints are ignored. This
# type of window can be useful for certain situations.
# When you are alt-tabbing through the windows, conky window will not be
# selected by marking it override

# If own_window is yes, you may use these window manager hints to
# affect the way Conky displays. Notes: Use own_window_type
# desktop as another way to implement many of these hints
# implicitly. If you use own_window_type override, window manager
# hints have no meaning and are ignored.
